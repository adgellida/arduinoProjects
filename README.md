A collection of arduino Projects on developing state.

Project list
=============================================
* [alarm](https://github.com/adgellida/arduinoProjects/tree/master/alarm)

0% Completed.

An alarm system. Notifications via: GSM, Internet, bluetooth, wifi.

* [alarmOverflowingLiquid](https://github.com/adgellida/arduinoProjects/tree/master/alarmOverflowingLiquid)

100% Completed.

When water overcomes the middle of the water sensor a LED blinks, if not the LED is OFF.

Applications: Based on a maxim level, checks if a liquid is overflowing it and an alarm sounds. For example air aconditioner.

* [arduinoPicProgrammer](https://github.com/adgellida/arduinoProjects/tree/master/arduinoPicProgrammer)

0% Completed.

Usefull if you want to burn a program or bootloader on a Microchip PIC with an Arduino.

* [bionicFinger](https://github.com/adgellida/arduinoProjects/tree/master/bionicFinger)

100% Completed.

Touch the button repeately to score high!

Libraries picked from [here](https://github.com/WickedDevice/SoftReset)

Applications: Games.

* [homeAutomation](https://github.com/adgellida/arduinoProjects/tree/master/homeAutomation)

0% Completed.

You can execute voice controls to control all that you want on your house.
Advanced management of your home resources: Shopping basket, ilumination, temperature, switching-on-off devices, etc.

* [irCommunication](https://github.com/adgellida/arduinoProjects/tree/master/irCommunication)

100% Completed.

Push IR remote buttons to do actions!

If you push button 2 a LED turns ON, if you push another time it turns OFF.

Do the same with button 3.

It doesn't work perfect but is very functional.

Applications: You can connect outputs to anything and you control them with an IR remote control.

Libraries picked from [NECIRrcv](http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1210243556)

and [DigitalToggle](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/DigitalToggle) - DigitalToggle library has been modified to work properly.

* [motionActivatedCamera](https://github.com/adgellida/arduinoProjects/tree/master/motionActivatedCamera)

0% Completed.

Take pictures with camera when motion is detected, using a PIR sensor. It notificates you via mail. 

* [powerOffMonitorBasedOnPresence](https://github.com/adgellida/arduinoProjects/tree/master/powerOffMonitorBasedOnPresence)

30% Completed.

Power off your monitor if you go away from your desk and power on if you return.
For now if sensor detects you blinks a LED for 2-3 seconds aprox.

TO DO:

* Change LED state with command to power ON/OFF monitor.
* If sensor detects you go away power OFF monitor.
